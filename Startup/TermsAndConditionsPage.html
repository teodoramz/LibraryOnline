                CONFIDENTIALITY
                All confidential, non-public information one party receives from the other in its performance of this Agreement that is marked “confidential” or that the other party knows, or reasonably should know, is confidential to such party, including software and information relating to products, pricing, Intellectual Property, technical information, business strategies (including the existence of, the terms of and its position in any dispute in relation to an Agreement), employees, officers, contractors and agents and customers (“Confidential Information”), will be held in confidence and only be used strictly in accordance with this Agreement and not for any other purposes and will not, without the express written consent of the disclosing party, be used or disclosed except to those of the receiving party’s representatives who are bound to substantially similar obligations of confidentiality and have a need to know. Each party will be responsible and liable for the acts and omissions of its representatives to the same extent as if performed by such party. In any case, the receiving party shall exercise at least the same standard of care to protect such information from unauthorised disclosure or use as it uses to protect its own confidential information of a similar nature, which in no event shall be less than reasonable care. For the avoidance of doubt, information which (a) is in the public domain at the time of its disclosure by disclosing party or thereafter; (b) was properly in the receiving party’s possession prior to such disclosure by disclosing party; or (c) was disclosed to receiving party by a third party who did not obtain such Confidential Information, directly or indirectly, from the other party subject to any confidentiality obligation, will not be considered Confidential Information under an Agreement. Notwithstanding the confidentiality obligations under an Agreement, the receiving party is free to make disclosure of any Confidential Information in a judicial, legislative, or administrative investigation or proceeding or to a government or other regulatory agency; provided that, to the extent permitted by the circumstances, the receiving party provides to disclosing party prior written notice of the intended disclosure to enable the disclosing party the reasonable opportunity to contest or limit such disclosure (including reasonable assistance at disclosing party’s expense) or, if prior written notice is not permitted, prompt notice of such disclosure. Each party acknowledges that the disclosure of Confidential Information may cause irreparable injury to the party whose information is disclosed. Therefore, each party is, upon a disclosure or threatened disclosure of any Confidential Information, entitled to seek injunctive relief. This provision shall not in any way limit such other remedies as may be available to such party at law or in equity.
                GENERAL

                If we fail at any time to insist upon strict performance of our obligations under this Agreement, or if we fail to exercise any of the rights or remedies to which we are entitled to under this Agreement, this will not constitute a waiver of any such rights or remedies and shall not relieve you from compliance with such obligations.
